# custom_todolist_mongoose
This Todo-list uses mongodb to store the items. 
It is not a single page website that stores and delete items. It can save various todo-lists altogether instead. For example, If you want to have a todo-list named "Work", then simply append "work" to the existing url and a new list titled "Work" is created.
So, whatever lists you want to have, just append it to heroku app url i.e. "https://custom-todo-list.herokuapp.com/your_listName".

To save an item to the list, click on + button at the bottom of the list. To delete the item, tick the checkbox to the left of the task and then it will be deleted.
